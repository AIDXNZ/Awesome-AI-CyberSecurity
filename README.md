# Basic Introduction
To help classify and aggergrate research there will be 4 main categories for this repo:

1. Exploiting the Training Process or at Data collection
   - Reffered to as poisoning, is the process of injecting malicous or faulty data to a Machine Learning model.
2. Exploiting a Pre-trained model
   - Reffers to exploiting a ML's input to get a desired output. 
3. ML/AI Supported hacking
   - Reffers to offensive hacking use AI/ML tools. 
4. ML/AI Supported Security
   - Reffers to Information Security use of AI/ML tools.

## Problems in AI and Machine Learning Models
There are numerous amounts of ways to exploit a machine learning model. Most of which can be summed down into 3 categories. 

Evasion attacks - Hackers provide faulty algorithm inputs, leading to incorrect decisions.

Poisoning attacks - Hackers provide poisoned data for training sets. which corrupt the machine learning algorithm and spoil the data mining process.

Privacy attacks - Hackers use the training phase to try and retrieve private data from the algorithm.

## Personalized Phishing/Social Engineering attacks using AI
